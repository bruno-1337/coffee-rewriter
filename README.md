        *   Or, open the Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd+P) and search for "Coffee Rewriter: Quick Rewrite (Paragraph / Selection)".
    *   **Process**: The plugin will use your "Quick Rewrite" prompt template to improve the text.
    *   **Review**: A modal will appear showing the original text and the rewritten text with changes highlighted. You'll also see any "Note from the AI" explaining the changes. Click "Accept" to apply or "Cancel".
